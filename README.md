# Simple Spotify Web (actually: Create Playlist Spotify Web)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Intro

Nowdays, Javascript can be anywhere and everywhere. Using React as Frontend Library, this web can be learning track for me and also for side project as React is the most wanted library to learn (as [StackOverflow 2021 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021?_ga=2.236209345.190202062.1628102352-126161871.1625855113#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks)). I like listening to music with Spotify, then I want to try using their API as my project (and for GIGIH Final Project of course ðŸ˜„). But because of complexity in Audio API, currently this app only serve as Create Playlist and Show Saved Library from User. Yeah, that is for the intro.

## Features
